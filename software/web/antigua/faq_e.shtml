  <strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>What is ZX-Uno?</strong>
      <br/>
      Basically it's a FPGA based board focused in the synthesis of ZX Spectrum computer models.
      It has the same size of a Raspberry Pi (85.60x56mm) so it would fit into a RasPi case. There are other 8 bit machines in development to be implemented under the same hardware.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>What machines would fit into the FPGA?</strong>
      <br/>
      Firstly it's intended to the whole range of ZX Spectrum machines and extra features like ULAPlus, Turbosound, etc, but also will
      accept other machines with the same or less complexity. Only will fit 8 bit machines
      with a maximum size of 512Kb between ROM and RAM, with a simple hardware to
      shyntetize (nothing about hardware sprites or similar stuff). The core of the
      machine is a Xilinx FPGA Spartan XC6SLX9, that it's relatively modest, but big enough to synthetize several 8 bit machines.
      Using a bigger FPGA would suposse more machines that can be  shyntetized, but also
      the price would raise considerably.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Which connectors are included?</strong>
      <br/>
      The board is designed to use the same enclosures as the Raspberry Pi ones, so the
      connectors follow the same layout and are the next:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video:</strong> Composite video throw RCA connector, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Stereo audio throw a 3.5mm stereo jack, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> PS/2 connector in the same place of the Ethernet connector in the RPi case</li>
        <li><strong>Power:</strong> Regulated 5V throw a micro-USB connector, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Joystick:</strong> DB9 Atari port, in the same place of USB ports in the RPi case</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> SD card, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Tape Load:</strong> 3.5mm jack conector, next to the JTAG/RGB connector. Not RPi compatible, you must make the hole</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> 3x12 female pin header, in the same position of the RPi layout</li>
        <li><strong>RGB and VGA: </strong>9 pin Micro-JST connector in place of HDMI connector of RPi. Custom cable must be made.</li>
        <li><strong>JTAG: </strong>6 pin Micro-JST, internal connector. </li></ul></li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Why has no EDGE conector like the original ZX Spectrum?</strong>
      <br/>
      Well, it just has not it.... yet ;) Basically it exists an electrical incompatibility. The FPGA works at 3.3V and the ZX
      Spectrum expansion works at 5V. Also because his compact sized and his “low cost”
      price (voltage level shifters would raise the price). Anyway, there is a generic
      expansion connector with 36 lines mapped directly in the FPGA, so it's theorically
      possible to build an adaptor board with level shifters inside. We are studying it.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Would it be very complex to add USB support (joystick and keyboard)? Nowdays
        it's hard to find new PS/2 keyboards and would be nice to have a second joystick.</strong>
      <br/>
      Yes, it would be complex and also it has incompatible voltage levels. If someone
      manages to implement it throw the expansion port, we can add in a future revision
      of the board. But now we have to settle with the PS/2 one. Anyway, you can find PS/2 keyboards on shops easily nowadays.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Do I need a special cable?</strong>
      <br/>
      Only for the prototype, specifically the Xilinx Platform Cable. In the final
      version it's not necessary because we'll grant the SD upgrade facility. The rest
      of the cables are generic: the power cable is micro-USB, the video one is RCA
      and the audio/EAR one are 3.5mm jacks. The only custom cable (like it happens
      in all machines) is the RGB/Scart/VGA one, but it isn't very important because the
      video quality in the composite signal is excelent thanks to the AD724.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How to use the SD card? Does it allow TZX files or only basic TAP ones?</strong>
      <br/>
      TZX is a compact audio format that only will work with the EAR port. The systems
      that supports TZX (e. g. ResiDOS) really only support a subset of the TZX
      specification, essentially the part that is like the TAP files. However TAP
      files allways allow loading from mass memory. ZX-UNO use divMMC with ESXDOS ROM, so it supports TAP, SNA and Z80 snapshots, and TRD disk images.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Can I write on tapes or disks (TRD or DSK)?</strong>
      <br/>
      Since this is not emulation, this possibility depends on the OS that you put on the
      ZX Spectrum. ESXDOS can write into TAP files using .TAPEOUT command. In addition, ESXDOS is able to read and write from and to TRD disk images.<br>
      <br>
    About DSK: if any of the OS supports it, then yes; but if not, no. Emulators support
      DSK or TRD because they emulate the hardware of the disk drive. Here you could
      implement something like that but probably would not fit in the FPGA. To give
      you an idea, to support DSK or TRD transparently (without using a special OS that
      is who is responsible for it) implies implementing a chip that has the same interface as the uPD765. That is,
      records uPD support and physical interface (data bus, CS, etc).
      and a system that allow to choose a TRD or DSK image, and this system
      must send the information (sector) on demand. That is, we must integrate a
      microcontroller that is who is responsible for reading the SD card, present some
      kind of OSD menu to choose the image to use, etc.<br/>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Does it fit the <em>russian clones</em> or the SAM Coupé?</strong>
      <br/>
      Very probably yes. Regarding the SAM, in fact it is already implemented partially. It works, apart from some Z80 timing flaws, it loads software via audio IN very well. Furthermore
      would fit the ZX80, ZX81, Jupiter ACE (currently implemented too) and some arcades than only have a single Z80
      like Pacman.<br>
      <br>
      With the upgraded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-6), bigger than the used in v1 prototypes (Spartan-3), we could port cores of several machines. At this time, they are being developed, some of them work totally or partially: SAM Coupé, Jupiter ACE, Sega Master System, Acorn Atom, Oric Atmos, Vic-20, Apple II, Lady Bug arcade...
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How many upgrades are allowed by the chip?</strong>
      <br/>
      As many upgrades as allow the SPI Flash, I think thousands or houndreds of thousands.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>I bought the prototype but I don't know how to solder the SMD components. Any help?</strong>
      <br/>
      Search it on Google. I found a good tutorial
      <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Solder-SMD-ICs-the-easy-way/">
        here.</a></li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How much it costs?</strong>
      <br/>
      <strike>I hope that the final board with SMD mounted and connectors unmounted will costs
      about 30 euros. The prototype is cheaper because it is not mounted. For my part
      I will not increase the cost of the PCB from seeedstudio for prototypes. For the
      final version, if the distribution is entrusted to another person, I can not rule
      out that there is some benefit, especially since require additional work: welding
      connectors, burn firmware, test PCB, packaging, etc...</strike>
      <br>
      <br>
    <strong>Upgrade Feb. 2016:</strong> Crowdfunding campaign is planned in March 2016. Final price is estimated to be near 58-60 euro plus shipping costs. We did our best to maintain the price low.    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Who work in the project?</strong>
      <br/>
      We are 5 guys.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>McLeod.</strong> Reviews and proposes, is a de facto partner.</li>
        <li><strong>Superfo.</strong> Router, which is responsible for designing the PCB.</li>
        <li><strong>AntonioVillena.</strong> Initial idea, scheme design and prototype distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest</strong>. Ports of secondary cores. Multiboot system. Firmware and prototypes collaboration</li>
        <li><strong>Hark0.</strong> Graphic and web designer.</li></ul>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>When will be the launch date?</strong>
      <br/>
      <strike>There is no estimated date specific, in principle there will be 2 runs: one for
      developers (prototype) 10 units already made ​​and another for the general public,
      50 or 100 units. The prototype PCBs together with the components and shipping
      for 22 euros (in Spain). These prototypes come unassembled and unprogrammed
      (Xilinx USB cable required), why they are so cheap. The final version (mounted
      and programmed) is estimated to have cost between 30 and 40 euros.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On the final board, do not know if I who was responsible and discuss everything
      that is subject to change. Will be 50 or 100 units and will be request to sitopway.
      It will go almost all mounted except connectors that optionally can be hand soldering
      by request for an additional price. The firmware will be pre-programmed, and there
      will be an option to purchase separate accessories: box, sticker logo, manual,
      cables, power supply.</strike><br>
