  <strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>What is ZX-Uno?</strong>
      <br/>
      Basically it's a FPGA based board focused in the synthesis of ZX Spectrum models.
      It has the same size of a Raspberry Pi (85.60x56mm) so it would fit into a RasPi case.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>What machines would fit into the FPGA and what connectors it has?</strong>
      <br/>
      Firstly it's intended to the whole range of ZX Spectrum machines, but also will
      accept other machines with the same or less complexity. Only will fit 8 bit machines
      with a maximum size of 512Kb between ROM and RAM, with a simple hardware to
      shyntetize (nothing about hardware sprites or similar stuff). The core of the
      machine is a Xilinx FPGA, exactly the model XC3S250E, that it's relatively modest.
      Using a bigger FPGA would suposse more machines that can be  shyntetized, but also
      the price would raise considerably.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Which connectors are included?</strong>
      <br/>
      The board is designed to use the same enclosures as the Raspberry Pi ones, so the
      connectors follow the same layout and are the next:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video:</strong> Composite video throw RCA connector, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Stereo audio throw a 3.5mm stereo jack, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> PS/2 connector in the same place of the Ethernet connector in the RPi case</li>
        <li><strong>Power:</strong> Regulated 5V throw a micro-USB connector, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Joystick:</strong> DB9 Atari port, in the same place of USB ports in the RPi case</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> SD card, RPi case compatible</li>
        <li><strong>Tape Load:</strong> 3.5mm jack conector, next to the JTAG/RGB connector. Not RPi compatible, you must make the hole</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> 3x14 male pin header, in the same position of the RPi layout</li>
        <li><strong>JTAG and RGB:</strong> 2x6 right angle male pin header, in the same place of the HDMI port in the RPi case</li></ul></li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Why has no EDGE conector like the original ZX Spectrum?</strong>
      <br/>
      Basically because electrical incompatibility. The FPGA works at 3.3V and the ZX
      Spectrum expansion works at 5V. Also because his compact sized and his “low cost”
      price (voltage level shifters would raise the price). Anyway, there is a generic
      expansion connector with 36 lines mapped directly in the FPGA, so it's theorically
      possible to build an adaptor board with level shifters inside.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Would it be very complex to add USB support (joystick and keyboard)? Nowdays
        it's hard to find new PS/2 keyboards and would be nice to have a second joystick.</strong>
      <br/>
      Yes, it would be complex and also it has incompatible voltage levels. If someone
      manages to implement it throw the expansion port, we can add in a future revision
      of the board. But now we have to settle with the PS/2 one.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Do I need a special cable?</strong>
      <br/>
      Only for the prototype, specifically the Xilinx Platform Cable. In the final
      version it's not necessary because we'll grant the SD upgrade facility. The rest
      of the cables are generic: the power cable is micro-USB, the video one is RCA
      and the audio/EAR one are 3.5mm jacks. The only custom cable (like it happens
      in all machines) is the RGB/Scart one, but it isn't very important because the
      video quality in the composite signal is excelent thanks to the AD724.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How to use the SD card? Does it allow TZX files or only basic TAP ones?</strong>
      <br/>
      TZX is a compact audio format that only will work with the EAR port. The systems
      that supports TZX (e. g. ResiDOS) really only support a subset of the TZX
      specification, essentially the part that is like the TAP files. However TAP
      files allways allow loading from mass memory.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Can I write on tapes or disks (TRD or DSK)?</strong>
      <br/>
      Since this is not emulation, this possibility depends on the OS that you put on the
      ZX Spectrum. ESXDOS can write into TAP files, if I remember. The same with the TRD
      or DSK: if any of the OS supports it, then yes; but if not, no. Emulators support
      DSK or TRD because they emulate the hardware of the disk drive. Here you could
      implement something like that but probably would not fit in the FPGA. To give
      you an idea, to support DSK or TRD transparently (without using a special OS that
      is who is responsible for it) implies:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - We need to implement a chip that has the same interface as the uPD765. That is,
      records uPD support and physical interface (data bus, CS, etc).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - But on the other hand, what is connected is not a floppy drive. Instead it must
      be replaced with a system that allow to choose a TRD or DSK image, and this system
      must send the information (sector) on demand. That is, we must integrate a
      microcontroller that is who is responsible for reading the SD card, present some
      kind of OSD menu to choose the image to use, and send the “half fake” information
      to the floppy controller. The Z80 occupies much of the FPGA, so not much room to
      implement another processor that is responsible for this task (besides the
      processor must include its small RAM and ROM, which must contain no less than
      routines that are capable of read FAT filesystems on SD).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - In other words: give that kind of support means putting inside the FPGA
      circuitry equivalent to a entire HxC (the autonomous version) replacing the LCD
      screen by OSD menu and special keys on the PS/2 keyboard for manage it.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Does it fit the <em>russian clones</em> or the SAM Coupé?</strong>
      <br/>
      Very probably yes. Regarding the SAM do not remember about the formatting palette,
      but if it use al least 3 bits per primary color, then yes, it can be implemented
      without problems (I'm assuming that the design will synthesize ULAplus). Furthermore
      would fit the ZX80, ZX81, Jupiter ACE and some arcades than only have a single Z80
      like Pacman.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How many upgrades are allowed by the chip?</strong>
      <br/>
      As many upgrades as allow the SPI Flash, I think thousands or houndreds of thousands.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>I bought the prototype but I don't know how to solder the SMD components. Any help?</strong>
      <br/>
      Search it on Google. I found a good tutorial
      <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Solder-SMD-ICs-the-easy-way/">
        here.</a></li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>How much it costs?</strong>
      <br/>
      I hope that the final board with SMD mounted and connectors unmounted will costs
      about 30 euros. The prototype is cheaper because it is not mounted. For my part
      I will not increase the cost of the PCB from seeedstudio for prototypes. For the
      final version, if the distribution is entrusted to another person, I can not rule
      out that there is some benefit, especially since require additional work: welding
      connectors, burn firmware, test PCB, packaging, etc...</li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>Who work in the project?</strong>
      <br/>
      We are four guys.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>McLeod.</strong> Reviews and proposes, is a de facto partner.</li>
        <li><strong>Superfo.</strong> Router, which is responsible for designing the PCB.</li>
        <li><strong>AntonioVillena.</strong> Initial idea, scheme design and prototype distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Hark0.</strong> Graphic and web designer.</li></ul>
    <br/>
    <li>
      <strong>When will be the launch date?</strong>
      <br/>
      There is no estimated date specific, in principle there will be 2 runs: one for
      developers (prototype) 10 units already made ​​and another for the general public,
      50 or 100 units. The prototype PCBs together with the components and shipping
      for 22 euros (in Spain). These prototypes come unassembled and unprogrammed
      (Xilinx USB cable required), why they are so cheap. The final version (mounted
      and programmed) is estimated to have cost between 30 and 40 euros.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On the final board, do not know if I who was responsible and discuss everything
      that is subject to change. Will be 50 or 100 units and will be request to sitopway.
      It will go almost all mounted except connectors that optionally can be hand soldering
      by request for an additional price. The firmware will be pre-programmed, and there
      will be an option to purchase separate accessories: box, sticker logo, manual,
      cables, power supply.</li></ol>
