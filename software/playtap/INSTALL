COMPILING
---------
For Win32 systems using native audio support and OpenWATCOM (also compilable with Visual Studio):
wmake -f Makefile.win32 playtap.exe
There's a ready to use executable in 'win32' subdirectory.

For systems with GCC and SDL development files (needs libsdl-mixer-dev too):
make -f Makefile.sdlmixer

For systems with GCC and SDL development files, and no SDL_mixer libs (also
compilable with C-Free / MinGW32):
make -f Makefile.sdl
There's a ready to use executable in 'win32sdl' directory.

For Linux with OSS enabled kernel (ALSA emulation is ok) and GCC:
make -f Makefile.linux

For Mac OS X with SDL framework and XCode:
make -f Makefile.osx
There's a ready to use universal binary (i386/ppc) in 'osx' directory.

USE
