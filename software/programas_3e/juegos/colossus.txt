Colossus Chess v4.2 for Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3
Note: the disk handling routines are +3DOS compatible (not Disciple)

Loading:
from the +3 Basic command prompt, type
load"colossus.bas" [ENTER]

Original game (c) 1986 Martin Bryant
Published by CDS Software Ltd.
Spectrum +3 disk conversion and printer routines (c) 1996 Cristian Secara

During the game, the file handling commands are the same as for tape.
Printer routines are based on +3 Basic "copy exp" command. To change from
parallel to serial or to modify the baud rate, use the standard +3 Basic
commands BEFORE loading Colossus Chess.

The Colossus Chess files were transferred from MS-DOS environment to *.DSK
disk image using CPCFS v:0.85.3 (c) 1996 Derik van Zuetphen.
You may use the *.DSK with the X128 Spectrum Emulator (c) James McKay.
If you like to run the present Colossus Chess package on an original
+3 Spectrum, you have to transfer all files from the *.DSK disk image to a
(temporar) directory by using CPCFS, then copy all files to a +3DOS compatible
diskette.
One way to do this is to use the PC2PLUS3 patch based on the Sydex's 22DISK
conversion program, using 720K DSDD diskettes.
Other way - I have no idea!
(22DISK may be obtained from http://www.sydex.com)
