Hello,

Welcome to the result of a little experiment - loader
which loads data encoded as a tune.

I have included the sources as well in case you are curious how it was done.
Basically delay encoding combined with variable duty wave form.

Apart from the included scripts, you will also
need PZX tools to create the actual PZX and/or WAV.

The loader source is included as well. Note that I have not bothered
with precise timing, but it could be easily improved by setting
the B register to correct values at appropriate places instead
of the start of LDWAVE routine.

Have fun,

Patrik Rak
