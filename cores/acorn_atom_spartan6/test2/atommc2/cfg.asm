; *PBD ([val])
;
; *PBD      - Print the current port B direction register in hex.
; *PBD 7F   - Set the direction register.
;
; Port B is 8 bits wide and each bit's direction is independently controllable.
; A set bit in the direction register indicates an 1nput and a clear bit represents
; an 0utput.

; *PBV ([val])
;
; *PBV      - Print the state of port B in hex.
; *PBV 7F   - Write value to port B.
;
; If a port B bit is set as an input, you will read the value present on the port.
; If it is an output you will see the last value written to it.

; *CFG      - Print the current port B direction register in hex.

;
; Bit 7 controls whether the boot loader is entered. 1 = enter, 0 = don't enter.
;     6 controls the action of the SHIFT key on boot. 1 = SHIFT+BREAK runs menu, 0 = menu runs unless SHIFT-BREAK pressed.
;     5 controls whether the interface generates an IRQ on reset. 1 = generate, 0 = don't.
