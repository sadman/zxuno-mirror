ESXDOS v0.8.5
(c) 2005-2013 Papaya Dezign
---------------------------

This version has the following (notable) new features (for detailed info checkout the changelog):

* Betadisk/TR-DOS Emulation: Supports (trimmed) .TRD files on all 4 drives. Uses new configuration file /SYS/CONFIG/TRDOS.CFG, which should be self-explanatory.
* DivMMC Support: Supports the DivMMC standard, available on the Zx-One FPGA core and Mario Prato's interface. This version directly supports MMC, SD and SDHC cards.
* Tape Emulator: Compatibility should be much higher now.
* NMI Browser: Online help is available at any time by pressing the "H" key. Can attach and auto-LOAD .TRD files (check help screen).
* New/Updated Commands: .divideo, .vdisk, .playwav, .dskprobe, .snapload, .gramon, .speakcz

How to (safely) install/upgrade:
--------------------------------

1. Copy esxide.tap/esxmmc.tap (depending on if you have a DivIDE or DivMMC, obviously) to your CF/SD/HDD, load it and follow the instructions. Power Off and remove media.
2. Copy the SYS, BIN (and create /TMP if using DivIDE) directories to your CF/SD/HDD.
3. Insert media. Power On. Reset while keeping space pressed to reinit if needed.

How to use the TR-DOS emulator:
-------------------------------

Either use the NMI browser to attach/auto-LOAD .TRDs, or use the .vdisk command:

.vdisk unit <filename>

Unit 0 = Drive A, Unit 1 = Drive B, etc. If you specify just the unit, it will eject the virtual drive. You can use .dskprobe to check the contents of the vdisk. Instructions on how to use TR-DOS are out of the scope of this document.

Notes:
------

a) TR-DOS emulation is not available in MapRAM mode (BETADISK.SYS will not be loaded).
b) If you replace the SYS directory *before* flashing the new ROM, your previous ROM of esxDOS will not boot correctly.
c) Questions? Bugreports? Complaints about lack of LFN/instructions? Ask on the usual places or send an e-mail to: bugs at esxdos dot org

Known Bugs
----------

BASIC/Tape Emulator: You can overwrite ESXDOS system using LOAD CODE that crosses $2000
Commands: Proper argument/syntax checking is not done yet on most commands
Commands/BASIC: No wildcards yet
FAT Driver: +3DOS header is set on file creation and never updated when file size changes
FAT Driver: rename() isn't even remotely posix compliant
FAT Driver: Directories read-only attribute isn't always respected
